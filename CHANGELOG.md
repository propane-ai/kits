### Added

- Initial set of six kits: CX (customer success), Marketing, Product, GTM (sales), Design, and Founder.
- Role and company context (`context/role.md`, `context/company.md`) so skills and commands stay aligned with your org and terminology.
- Marketplace manifest at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for multi-plugin repos.
- Design and Founder kits (Propane-original; not from upstream fork).

### Changed

- Fork of [Anthropic's knowledge-work-plugins](https://github.com/anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins) with expanded set and richer user/company context.
