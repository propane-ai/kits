# Competitive Design Brief

> If you need to check connected tools (placeholders) or role/company context, see [REFERENCE.md](../REFERENCE.md).

Create a competitive UX/UI analysis brief for one or more competitors or a feature area.

## Workflow

### 1. Scope the Analysis

Ask the user:
- **Competitor(s)**: Which specific competitor(s) to analyze? Or a feature/flow area to compare across competitors?
- **Focus**: Full product UX, specific flow (e.g. onboarding, checkout, settings), patterns, or accessibility?
- **Context**: What decision will this inform? (design direction, pattern adoption, accessibility baseline)

### 2. Research

**Via web search**:
- Product screenshots, demos, and walkthroughs
- Public design systems or pattern libraries (if available)
- Customer reviews mentioning UX (ease of use, clarity, confusion)
- Recent redesigns or product updates
- Accessibility statements or reports

If **~~knowledge base** is connected:
- Search for existing competitive design or UX analysis
- Find prior research on competitor flows or patterns

If **~~chat** is connected:
- Search for competitive UX mentions in design or product channels
- Find recent feedback involving competitor UX

If **~~design** is connected:
- Compare with our flows or components for the same feature area (if user requests)

### 3. Generate the Brief

#### Competitor Overview
For each competitor:
- Product and target user (brief)
- Design direction (visual style, tone, platform conventions)
- Recent UX-related changes if known

#### Flow / Feature Comparison
Compare UX across the scoped area. See the **competitive-design** skill for comparison frameworks.

- **Flow structure**: Steps, entry/exit, key screens
- **Patterns**: Navigation, forms, feedback, empty states, errors
- **Clarity and hierarchy**: How they prioritize information and actions
- **Consistency**: Within the flow and with platform/design system

Use tables or structured bullets. Call out what works well and what does not.

#### Accessibility Comparison
Where possible, note:
- Accessibility claims or certifications (WCAG level, VPAT)
- Common a11y patterns (keyboard, focus, labels, contrast)
- Gaps or strengths relative to our product or to best practices

#### Strengths and Weaknesses (UX)
For each competitor in scope:
- **Strengths**: Where their UX genuinely excels. What users praise.
- **Weaknesses**: Where their UX falls short. Confusion, friction, complaints.
- Be evidence-based — use reviews, observations, or documented issues where possible.

#### Design Implications
Tie the analysis back to our design work:
- What should we adopt, adapt, or avoid?
- Where can we differentiate on UX?
- What accessibility or pattern improvements should we prioritize?
- What should we monitor (e.g. competitor redesigns)?

### 4. Follow Up

After generating the brief:
- Ask if the user wants to dive deeper on any section
- Offer to create a one-page summary for design or product
- Offer to turn implications into design backlog items
- Offer to set up a lightweight monitoring plan (e.g. quarterly UX check)

## Output Format

Use tables for flow/feature comparisons. Use clear headers for each section. Keep the design implications section concise and actionable.

## Tips

- Be honest about competitor UX strengths. Dismissing them makes the brief useless.
- Focus on what matters to users: clarity, efficiency, accessibility, consistency.
- Customer reviews are gold for UX — they reveal what real users find easy or frustrating.
- Accessibility is part of UX. Include it even if the user did not ask explicitly.
- The most valuable part is the "so what" — design implications. Do not skip it.
- Competitive UX changes over time. Note the date and flag areas that change quickly.
