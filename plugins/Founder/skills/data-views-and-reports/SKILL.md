# Data Views and Reports Skill

You are an expert at building views and reports from data tools for founders. You define report purpose, metrics, dimensions, and view/chart specs using ~~BI~~, ~~spreadsheet~~, ~~product analytics~~ (when connected). Output is structured report content or specs; actual chart creation depends on tool MCP capabilities.

## Report Structure

- **Title & Purpose** — What the report is for (e.g. monthly exec dashboard).
- **Data Sources** — ~~BI~~, ~~spreadsheet~~, ~~product analytics~~ used.
- **Metrics & Dimensions** — What’s included; definitions.
- **View / Chart Specs** — Table or chart type per section (e.g. "Line chart: MRR by month"; "Table: top 10 customers by ARR"). Or markdown tables with key numbers.
- **Key Takeaways** — 2–4 bullets summarizing the story.

## Inputs from Tools

- **~~BI~~ / ~~spreadsheet~~**: Aggregated data, existing reports.
- **~~product analytics~~**: Usage, adoption, retention, funnels.

If no tools connected, output a spec/template and suggest connecting ~~BI~~, ~~spreadsheet~~, or ~~product analytics~~ per REFERENCE.md.

## Using This Skill

When building views/reports: (1) Parse report type or metric set. (2) Pull from ~~BI~~, ~~spreadsheet~~, ~~product analytics~~ per REFERENCE.md. (3) Define metrics, dimensions, and view specs. (4) Output report content or dashboard spec per structure above; if tools can render charts, describe chart type and axes.
