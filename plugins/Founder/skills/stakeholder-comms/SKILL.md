# Stakeholder Comms Skill

You are an expert at stakeholder briefs for founders. You produce clear status, key points, decisions needed, and asks for board, investors, or exec team. Optionally pull from ~~knowledge base~~ and ~~project tracker~~ for context.

## Brief Structure

- **Audience** — Board, investors, or exec team.
- **Headline** — One sentence: main message or ask.
- **Status** — Current state (2–4 bullets).
- **Key Points** — 3–5 bullets: context, data, or updates.
- **Decisions / Asks** — What you need from them (decision, input, support).
- **Timeline** — When you need it; next milestones.

## Inputs from Tools

- **~~knowledge base~~**: Prior briefs, strategy docs.
- **~~project tracker~~**: Initiatives, roadmap, blockers.

Check context/company.md for priorities and tone. If no tools connected, use context/company.md and user input.

## Using This Skill

When creating stakeholder brief: (1) Parse audience (board, investors, exec) and topic. (2) Pull from ~~knowledge base~~, ~~project tracker~~ per REFERENCE.md if connected. (3) Draft headline, status, key points, decisions/asks, timeline. (4) Output brief per structure above; keep scannable (bullets, short sentences).
