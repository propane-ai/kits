## Founder

### Role
Strategy, capital, talent, and company performance: investor relations, market and competitive context, hiring and org design, data and metrics oversight, finance and runway, board and stakeholder alignment.

### Job to be Done
Set direction, secure and manage capital, build and retain key talent, monitor company and product performance, and communicate clearly with investors, board, and leadership.

### Mission
Align vision, capital, talent, and execution so the company can scale sustainably and hit milestones that matter to stakeholders.

### Key Outcomes
Successful fundraising and investor confidence, runway and financial clarity, key hires and org health, board alignment and clear metrics, and a coherent company narrative.

### When to use other kits
For deep execution in a domain (e.g. competitive analysis, pipeline review, health scoring), use the corresponding kit command: Product (competitive brief, roadmap, metrics), GTM (pipeline, account research), Marketing (positioning, campaigns), CX (health, churn), Design (research, handoff). This Founder kit gives the full-stack view and founder-specific workflows (investors, board, hiring, runway, narrative, plans, pitch deck, sales or investor emails).
