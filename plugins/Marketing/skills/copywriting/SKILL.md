# Copywriting Skill

Guidelines for product copy and marketing copy: value propositions, feature descriptions, in-app and microcopy, headlines, CTAs, ad copy, landing page copy, and channel-specific copy (email, social).

## Data Sources

- **~~knowledge base~~** (if connected): Style guide, terminology, approved value props and headlines, tone guidelines. See [REFERENCE.md](../../REFERENCE.md).
- **Brand voice** (local settings or ~~knowledge base~~): Apply voice attributes, tone spectrum, and terminology consistently across product and marketing copy.

If no style guide is connected, ask the user for key guidelines or use clear, consistent, professional defaults.

## Product Copy

### Value propositions and feature descriptions

- **Benefit-first** — lead with what the user gains, not what the feature is
- **Concrete** — specific outcomes, numbers, or scenarios where possible
- **Scannable** — short sentences, bullets, one idea per block
- **Consistent** — use approved terms and positioning from ~~knowledge base~~ when available

### In-app copy and microcopy

- **Clear** — no jargon; one intended meaning
- **Concise** — minimal words; buttons 1–3 words where possible
- **Action-oriented** — verbs for buttons and links (e.g. "Save", "Continue", "Learn more")
- **Error and empty states** — explain what happened or what’s missing; suggest next step
- **Tone** — match product voice; friendly but not casual unless the brand allows

Use ~~knowledge base~~ for product voice and terminology; flag terms that conflict with style guide.

## Marketing Copy

### Headlines

- **Benefit or outcome** in under 10 words where possible
- **Keyword-inclusive** for SEO when relevant
- **Variants** — offer 2–3 options (e.g. benefit, curiosity, question)
- **Length** — 50–60 characters for titles; platform limits for social

### CTAs

- **Verb-first** — "Get started", "Download", "Subscribe", "Book a demo"
- **Specific** — what happens next (e.g. "Get the guide" not "Submit")
- **One primary CTA** per unit (page, email, ad); secondary only when justified
- **Urgency or value** when appropriate — "Start free trial", "Save 20% today"

### Ad copy

- **Hook** in first line; benefit or curiosity
- **Constraint** — character limits by platform (e.g. search, social)
- **Consistency** — match landing page and brand voice
- **Testing** — suggest A/B variants (headline, CTA, angle)

### Landing page copy

- **Headline + subheadline** — benefit and brief elaboration
- **Hero** — one primary message and one primary CTA
- **Sections** — 3–4 value or benefit blocks; social proof; FAQ or objections
- **Single primary CTA** repeated in hero and close

### Email and social

- **Subject lines / first line** — curiosity or clear value; under 50 characters for email subject where possible
- **Body** — short paragraphs, one idea per block, single primary CTA
- **Platform** — length and tone by channel (e.g. LinkedIn vs. Twitter vs. Instagram)

Pull style guide and approved phrases from ~~knowledge base~~; apply brand voice throughout.

## Principles for Both Product and Marketing Copy

- **Clarity** — no ambiguity; one takeaway per unit
- **Consistency** — same terms and tone across touchpoints
- **Hierarchy** — most important message first; support with detail
- **Accessibility** — plain language; avoid idioms and unexplained acronyms
- **Review** — check against brand voice and style guide (see review-brand command and brand-voice skill)

## Using This Skill

When drafting or reviewing product or marketing copy:

1. Confirm audience, channel, and goal (e.g. convert, educate, re-engage).
2. Pull style guide and brand voice from ~~knowledge base~~ or local settings per [REFERENCE.md](../../REFERENCE.md).
3. Apply product copy rules (value props, features, in-app, microcopy) or marketing copy rules (headlines, CTAs, ad, landing, email, social) as appropriate.
4. Output draft or review notes; flag deviations from style guide or terminology.
