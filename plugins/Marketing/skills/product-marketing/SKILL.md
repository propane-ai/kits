# Product Marketing Skill

Frameworks for product positioning, messaging, value propositions, launch narrative, differentiation, and sales/GTM enablement. Supports campaign planning, competitive briefs, and product-focused content.

## Data Sources

- **~~knowledge base~~** (if connected): Positioning docs, messaging pillars, battlecards, launch playbooks, product narratives. See [REFERENCE.md](../../REFERENCE.md).
- **~~CRM~~** (if connected): Segment and buyer context, deal themes, competitive win/loss; use for audience and messaging alignment.
- **~~product analytics~~** (if connected): Feature adoption, usage patterns, conversion signals; use to ground value props and launch narrative in real usage.

If a tool is not connected, use what the user provides and note what would improve the output (e.g. "Positioning would be sharper with access to ~~knowledge base~~").

## Positioning Framework

- **Target audience** — who you serve (role, company type, pain points, desired outcome)
- **Category** — how you frame the product (category you create vs. compete in)
- **Differentiation** — why you vs. alternatives (including status quo)
- **Proof** — evidence that supports the claim (data, case studies, third-party validation)

One-sentence positioning: "[Product] helps [audience] [achieve outcome] by [key differentiator], unlike [alternatives]."

## Messaging Pillars

- **Core message** — one sentence that captures what you want the audience to think, feel, or do
- **Supporting pillars** — 3–5 themes that provide evidence, address objections, or elaborate on benefits
- **Proof points** — data, case studies, testimonials for each pillar
- **Tone and voice** — how the message is delivered (authoritative, approachable, technical, etc.)

Align with brand voice from ~~knowledge base~~ or local settings when available.

## Value Propositions

- **Outcome-focused** — what the customer gains (e.g. time saved, risk reduced, revenue increased)
- **Differentiated** — what only you offer or do better
- **Concrete** — specific and measurable where possible
- **Audience-specific** — tailored to role, segment, or buying stage

Use ~~product analytics~~ for adoption and usage evidence; use ~~knowledge base~~ for approved value prop language.

## Launch Narrative

- **Teaser** — create curiosity without full reveal
- **Announcement** — what, for whom, why now
- **Proof** — early results, customer quotes, data
- **Call to action** — try it, learn more, talk to us
- **Ongoing story** — feature spotlights, use cases, customer wins

Pull launch playbooks and narrative from ~~knowledge base~~ when connected.

## Sales/GTM Enablement

- **Battlecards** — competitor comparison, key differentiators, objection handling (from ~~knowledge base~~ or competitive brief)
- **Demo narrative** — flow that shows value fast, tailored to segment
- **ROI / value stories** — quantified outcomes for sales conversations
- **Competitive win themes** — why we win; use ~~CRM~~ deal themes and competitive brief output when available

## Using This Skill

When planning a campaign, drafting a competitive brief, or creating product-focused content:

1. Clarify audience, goal, and any positioning or messaging constraints.
2. Pull positioning, messaging, and proof from ~~knowledge base~~, ~~CRM~~, ~~product analytics~~ per [REFERENCE.md](../../REFERENCE.md) when connected.
3. Apply positioning, messaging pillars, value props, and (for launches) launch narrative above.
4. Output clear, differentiated messaging and note data gaps (e.g. "Connect ~~knowledge base~~ for battlecards").
