# SEO Strategy Skill

Guidelines and frameworks for SEO audits, keyword research, content gap analysis, on-page optimization, and competitor SEO comparison.

## Data Sources

- **~~SEO~~** (if connected): Keyword data, search volume, difficulty scores, ranking positions, backlink profiles. See [REFERENCE.md](../../REFERENCE.md) for included servers (e.g. Ahrefs, Similarweb) and alternatives.
- **~~product analytics~~** (if connected): Cross-reference keyword targets with organic traffic and conversions to validate which keywords drive visits and conversions.

If no tools are connected, use web search for the keyword landscape and note: "For precise volume and difficulty data, connect an SEO tool via MCP per REFERENCE.md."

## Keyword Research Framework

- **Primary keywords** — high-intent terms tied to the product or service
- **Secondary keywords** — supporting terms and variations
- **Long-tail opportunities** — lower-competition phrases with clear intent
- **Question-based keywords** — "how to", "what is", "why does" (People Also Ask)
- **Intent classification** — informational, navigational, commercial, transactional

Assess each opportunity: search demand (high/medium/low), difficulty (easy/moderate/hard), relevance, and recommended content type.

## On-Page SEO Checklist

- Title tags: unique, 50–60 characters, target keyword
- Meta descriptions: compelling, 150–160 characters, CTA
- H1: exactly one per page, primary keyword
- H2/H3: logical hierarchy, secondary keywords
- Keyword usage: first 100 words, natural throughout, no stuffing
- Internal linking: related content, descriptive anchors, orphan pages identified
- Image alt text: descriptive, keywords where relevant
- URL structure: clean, readable, keyword-inclusive

## Content Gap Analysis

- **Competitor topic coverage** — topics competitors rank for that the site does not
- **Content freshness** — pages not updated in 12+ months
- **Thin content** — insufficient depth (e.g. under 300 words for informational)
- **Missing content types** — guides, comparison pages, glossaries, tools
- **Funnel gaps** — missing content at awareness, consideration, decision stages
- **Topic clusters** — pillar pages with supporting content

## Technical SEO Foundations

- Page speed, mobile-friendliness, structured data (FAQ, HowTo, Product, Article)
- Crawlability: robots.txt, sitemap, canonicals, noindex/nofollow
- Broken links, HTTPS, Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID/INP, CLS), indexation risks

## Competitor SEO Comparison

Compare: keyword overlap and gaps, domain authority signals, content depth, publishing frequency, backlink profile, SERP feature ownership, technical advantages.

## Using This Skill

When auditing SEO or researching keywords:

1. Define scope: URL/domain, audit type (full, keyword, content gap, technical, competitor).
2. Pull data from ~~SEO~~ and ~~product analytics~~ per [REFERENCE.md](../../REFERENCE.md) when connected.
3. Apply keyword research, on-page, content gap, and technical frameworks above.
4. Output prioritized action plan: quick wins (this week) and strategic investments (this quarter).
