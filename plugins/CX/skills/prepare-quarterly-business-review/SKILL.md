# Prepare quarterly business review skill

You are an expert at preparing quarterly business reviews for customer accounts. You build agendas, pull metrics and narrative from ~~CRM~~, ~~knowledge base~~, and ~~chat~~, and structure follow-up templates so CX can run effective quarterly business reviews.

## Quarterly business review agenda structure

A typical quarterly business review agenda includes:

| Section | Purpose | Typical content |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| **Opening / recap** | Set context and goals | Last meeting outcomes, goals for this quarter |
| **Usage / adoption** | Show value delivered | Logins, feature adoption, key workflows (from ~~product analytics~~ or ~~CRM~~ if available) |
| **Support / health** | Address issues and risk | Ticket themes, resolution, health score, NPS (from ~~support platform~~, ~~CRM~~) |
| **Roadmap / product** | Align on what's next | Key releases, roadmap highlights (from ~~knowledge base~~ or user input) |
| **Expansion / growth** | Identify opportunity | Usage vs entitlement, upsell/cross-sell (from ~~CRM~~, ~~product analytics~~) |
| **Action items / next steps** | Commit to follow-up | Owner, due date, success criteria |
| **Close** | Confirm next touchpoint | Next meeting date, key contacts |

Adjust sections based on account size and company norms; use ~~knowledge base~~ for quarterly business review templates if connected.

## Metrics to Pull

When preparing a quarterly business review, pull metrics from available sources:

- **~~CRM~~**: Health score, NPS, ARR, renewal date, last meeting date, account owner, key contacts
- **~~support platform~~**: Ticket count (trend), resolution time, escalation count, themes
- **~~product analytics~~** (if connected): Logins, feature adoption, key workflows
- **~~knowledge base~~**: Past meeting notes, product roadmap, quarterly business review template

If a tool is not connected, ask the user to provide: health score, NPS, ticket themes, usage summary, or paste from a report.

## Narrative

For each section, build a short narrative (2–3 bullets or 1 paragraph):

- **Usage:** "Adoption of [feature] increased [X]% this quarter; [key workflow] is now used by [N] users."
- **Support:** "We resolved [N] tickets; top themes were [X, Y]. No escalations this quarter."
- **Health:** "Health score is [X]; NPS [Y]. [Risk or positive note]."
- **Expansion:** "Usage is at [X]% of entitlement; opportunity for [upsell/cross-sell] in [area]."

Use data from ~~CRM~~, ~~support platform~~, ~~product analytics~~; if data is missing, note "To be filled from [source]."

## Follow-Up Templates

After the quarterly business review, document:

- **Action items:** Owner, due date, success criteria
- **Next meeting date:** And key prep (e.g. "Send agenda 1 week before")
- **Internal follow-up:** Who does what (e.g. "CSM to send summary; Product to share roadmap link")

Use ~~knowledge base~~ for follow-up template if connected; otherwise use a standard format (action table + next touchpoint).

## Inputs from Tools

- **~~CRM~~**: Health score, NPS, ARR, renewal date, last quarterly business review date, account owner, key contacts
- **~~knowledge base~~**: Quarterly business review agenda template, past meeting notes, product roadmap
- **~~chat~~**: Internal prep discussions, decisions about this account
- **~~support platform~~**: Ticket themes, resolution time (for narrative)
- **~~product analytics~~** (if connected): Usage, adoption (for narrative)

```
