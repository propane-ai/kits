# Install screenshots

Screenshots used in the main README install steps:

| File | Caption |
|------|---------|
| `add-marketplace.png` | Add to Marketplace |
| `install-team-plugin.png` | Install the team plugins |
| `see-command-skills.png` | See the commands and skills |
| `use-commands.png` | Use the commands |

If the desktop UI changes, re-capture and replace the same filenames. For smaller repo size, keep screenshots compressed (e.g. max width 1200px).
